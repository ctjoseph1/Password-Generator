# Password-Generator
Password Generator project
**Description**
The project at hand is to create a password generator where a user can define a specification for characters they wish to be included i.e Lower case, upper case, numeric values, and or special characters along with how long they wish for their password to be. It will work by the user clicking a button in the UI, selecting the said options, then as a developer I would use javascript methods to generate a final random password for the user and have it appear.

**How it went**
This challenge was difficult and I was unable to finish it within the time frame given. However stripping back and writing the pseudocode bit by bit really helped and is a method that I will use for future javascript challenges. I utilized prompts in order to get the user to select the criteria for their desired password. I then used var to create the different variables they can select, then if and do while statements to define what the next prompts will be depending on the users options. I also successfully created and alerts for if they did not select the correct options. Sadly, I was not able to complete the project to allow for the password to be generated in the UI for when they did select the correct prompts.

If I had more time, the intent was to create a conditional block that checks to see if the said variables have a true value, join two strings to a new array in order to use a randomized character function, along with math.random.

In future, I will begin by writing the full pseudo code and try to be cognisant of every single micro step in the creation of a functional webpage.
